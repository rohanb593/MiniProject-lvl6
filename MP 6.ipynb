The player chooses a weapon from their inventory, and the damage dealt to the monster is calculated based on the weapon's damage points. The monster's health is reduced by the weapon's damage, and if the monster's health reaches zero, the player defeats it and earns points based on the monster's value. The method continues to prompt the player for a valid weapon choice until the monster is defeated. If the player chooses an invalid weapon, they are prompted again. The player's points are updated once the monster is vanquished."
